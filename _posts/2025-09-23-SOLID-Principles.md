## **Introduction**

Have you ever looked at a piece of code and thought, "This is a mess"? We've all been there. Code that's hard to read, difficult to modify, and breaks whenever you touch it. The good news is that there's a way to avoid this nightmare – and it starts with understanding the SOLID principles.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore one of the most fundamental concepts in software engineering. Keep in mind that no single tutorial can make you an expert—you need consistent practice. This tutorial is meant to introduce you to the basic concepts. Also, be aware that there might be mistakes, so use it as a starting point rather than a definitive guide.

## **What are SOLID Principles?**

>The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. Introduced by Robert C. Martin , these principles serve as guidelines for writing clean, object-oriented code that stands the test of time.

**SOLID** is an acronym that stands for:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles aren't just theoretical concepts  they're practical tools that solve real problems developers face every day. When applied correctly, they help create code that is:

- **Easy to understand**: Each component has a clear, single purpose
- **Simple to modify**: Changes can be made without breaking existing functionality
- **Highly testable**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusable**: Well-designed components can be used across different parts of your application
- **Maintainable**: The codebase remains clean and organized as it grows

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Core Concept

**A module should have one and only one reason to change.**


>The Single Responsibility Principle is the cornerstone of clean architecture, as emphasized by Robert C. Martin in his book "Clean Architecture." At its core, SRP states that every software module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality and should encapsulate that part completely.

>But what does "single responsibility" really mean? It's not about doing only one thing—it's about having only one reason to change. As Uncle Bob explains, this principle is fundamentally about people. When you write a class, you should identify the actors (users, stakeholders, or systems) who might request changes to that class. If multiple actors could request changes for different reasons, then the class violates SRP.


### Example: Violating SRP

Let's look at a common violation of SRP  a class that handles both user data and email notifications:

!["Violating SRP Example"](assets/img/carbon.png)


#### Problems with this approach 

- **_Changes to email logic require modifying UserManager_**
- **_Changes to database logic also require modifying UserManager_**
- **_The class becomes harder to test and maintain_**



### Example: Following SRP


Here's how we can refactor this to follow SRP:

#### SRP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design aligns perfectly with clean architecture principles:

- **_UserRepository: Represents the data layer, handling persistence concerns_**

- **_EmailService: Represents external service integration, handling notification concerns_**

- **_UserService: Represents the use case layer, orchestrating business logic_**

- **_User: Represents the entity layer, containing core business data_**

Each class now has a single, well defined responsibility and can evolve independently. Changes to email logic only affect EmailService, database changes only affect UserRepository, and business logic changes only affect UserService.
