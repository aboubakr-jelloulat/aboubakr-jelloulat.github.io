## **Introduction**

Have you ever looked at a piece of code and thought, "This is a mess"? We've all been there. Code that's hard to read, difficult to modify, and breaks whenever you touch it. The good news is that there's a way to avoid this nightmare  and it starts with understanding the SOLID principles.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore one of the most fundamental concepts in software engineering. Keep in mind that no single tutorial can make you an expert you need consistent practice. This tutorial is meant to introduce you to the basic concepts. Also, be aware that there might be mistakes, so use it as a starting point rather than a definitive guide.

## **What are SOLID Principles?**

>The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. Introduced by Robert C. Martin , these principles serve as guidelines for writing clean, object-oriented code that stands the test of time.

**SOLID** is an acronym that stands for:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles aren't just theoretical concepts  they're practical tools that solve real problems developers face every day. When applied correctly, they help create code that is:

- **Easy to understand**: Each component has a clear, single purpose
- **Simple to modify**: Changes can be made without breaking existing functionality
- **Highly testable**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusable**: Well-designed components can be used across different parts of your application
- **Maintainable**: The codebase remains clean and organized as it grows

## **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)


<img src="/assets/img/S.memes.png" alt="memes" width="400">


### Core Concept

**A module should have one and only one reason to change.**


>The Single Responsibility Principle is the cornerstone of clean architecture, as emphasized by Robert C. Martin in his book "Clean Architecture." At its core, SRP states that every software module, class, or function should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality and should encapsulate that part completely.

>But what does "single responsibility" really mean? It's not about doing only one thingâ€”it's about having only one reason to change. As Uncle Bob explains, this principle is fundamentally about people. When you write a class, you should identify the actors (users, stakeholders, or systems) who might request changes to that class. If multiple actors could request changes for different reasons, then the class violates SRP.


### Example: Violating SRP

Let's look at a common violation of SRP  a class that handles both user data and email notifications:

!["Violating SRP Example"](/assets/img/carbon.png)


#### Problems with this approach 

- **_Changes to email logic require modifying UserManager_**
- **_Changes to database logic also require modifying UserManager_**
- **_The class becomes harder to test and maintain_**


### Example: Following SRP


Here's how we can refactor this to follow SRP:



!["Following SRP Example"](/assets/img/solutionsSRP.png) 


#### SRP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design aligns perfectly with clean architecture principles:

- **_UserRepository: Represents the data layer, handling persistence concerns_**

- **_EmailService: Represents external service integration, handling notification concerns_**

- **_UserService: Represents the use case layer, orchestrating business logic_**

- **_User: Represents the entity layer, containing core business data_**

Each class now has a single, well defined responsibility and can evolve independently. Changes to email logic only affect EmailService, database changes only affect UserRepository, and business logic changes only affect UserService.

## **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)


<img src="/assets/img/O.memes.png" alt="memes" width="400">

### Core Concept

**Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

>The Open/Closed Principle, as articulated by Robert C. Martin in "Clean Architecture," represents one of the most powerful concepts in software design. This principle states that you should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying its source code. In essence, your code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

>The genius of OCP lies in its ability to protect existing, working code from changes while still allowing new functionality to be added. As Uncle Bob emphasizes, this principle is the heart of object-oriented design it's what makes code flexible, reusable, and maintainable. When properly applied, OCP allows systems to be easily extended with new functionality without risking the stability of existing features.

### Example: Violating OCP

Let's examine a common violation of OCP a class that handles different notification types using conditional statements:

!["Violating OCP"](/assets/img/OCPViolatingOCP.png) 


#### Problems with this approach

- **_Adding new notification types requires modifying the NotificationService classs_**

- **_Risk of breaking existing functionality when adding new featuress_**

- **_Violates the principle that classes should be closed for modifications_**

- **_Testing becomes more complex as the class growss_**

### Example: Following OCP

Here's how we can refactor this design to follow OCP using interfaces:


!["Following OCP"](/assets/img/FollowingOCP.png) 


#### OCP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design embodies the essence of clean architecture and OCP:

- **_Shape (Abstract Interface): Defines the contract that all shapes must follows_**

- **_Concrete Shape Classes: Each encapsulates its own area calculation logics_**

- **_AreaCalculator: Depends on the abstraction, not concrete implementationss_**

- **_Extensibility: New shapes can be added without touching existing codes_**

## **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

<img src="/assets/img/L.memes.png" alt="memes" width="400">

### Core Concept
**you should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification.**


>The Liskov Substitution Principle, named after Barbara Liskov, is perhaps the most misunderstood of the SOLID principles. At its essence, LSP states that you should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification. It ensures that a derived class does not affect the behavior of the parent class in other words, a derived class must be substitutable for its base class.


>Think of it this way: if you have a function that works with a base class, it should work equally well with any of its subclasses without knowing which specific subclass it's dealing with. As Robert C. Martin explains in "Clean Architecture," this principle is what makes inheritance truly powerful and safe. When LSP is violated, you end up with fragile code that requires constant type checking and conditional logic.


### Example: Violating LSP

Let's look at a game engine where different character types have different capabilities:

!["Violating LSP Example"](/assets/img/ViolatingLSP.png)


#### Problems with this approach

- **_Ghost throws exception for Jump(), breaking substitutability_**
- **_Client code must know specific types to avoid calling Jump() on ghosts_**
- **_Violates LSP because you can't safely replace PlayerCharacter with Ghost_**
- **_Forces meaningless or error-prone implementations in subclasses_**



### Example: Following LSP

Here's how we can refactor this design to follow LSP using proper interfaces:

!["Following LSP Example"](/assets/img/FollowingLSP.png)


#### LSP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design perfectly demonstrates clean architecture and LSP compliance:

- **_PlayerCharacter (Base Class): Contains only behavior that ALL characters share_**

- **_ICanJump Interface: Segregates jumping capability to only characters that can jump_**

- **_Warrior: Implements both character movement and jumping capability_**

- **_Ghost: Implements only character movement, staying true to its ethereal nature_**

- **_Substitutability: Any PlayerCharacter can be used interchangeably without breaking client code_**

## **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)


<img src="/assets/img/I.memes.png" alt="memes" width="400">

### Core Concept

**that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each serving one submodule**

>The Interface Segregation Principle, as emphasized by Robert C. Martin in "Clean Architecture," states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This principle deals with the disadvantages of implementing large interfaces. When we force a class to implement an interface with methods it doesn't need, we create unnecessary coupling and violate the principle of separation of concerns.


>ISP teaches us to break down large, monolithic interfaces into smaller, more focused ones. This way, implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them. As Uncle Bob explains, this principle helps us avoid the problem of "fat interfaces" that bundle together methods that serve different clients or use cases.

### Real World Analogy



>Imagine a restaurant menu where all the food and drink options are cramped onto one overwhelming page. It includes breakfast items, lunch specials, dinner entrees, snacks, desserts, cocktails, and coffee drinks all mixed together in one chaotic list.

>If you're a customer who just wants breakfast, you'd have to wade through dozens of irrelevant dinner options, cocktail recipes, and dessert descriptions just to find the pancakes and eggs. It's frustrating, time consuming, and overwhelming.

>**_Now imagine the same restaurant with a thoughtfully organized menu system: separate, focused menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverages, and desserts. When you sit down for breakfast, you receive only the breakfast menu clean, relevant, and easy to navigate. You see exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less._**

>In software development, ISP works exactly like this well-organized restaurant. Instead of forcing clients to deal with one massive interface containing every possible method (like that overwhelming single page menu), we create smaller, focused interfaces that serve specific needs. Each client interacts only with the functionality that's relevant to them, making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to understand.


### Example: Violating ISP

Let's examine a violation of ISP with Amazon's payment system that forces all payment methods to implement every possible payment type:

!["Violating ISP Example"](/assets/img/ViolatingISP.png)


#### Problems with this approach

- **_AmazonCheckout is forced to implement Bitcoin payment it doesn't support_**
- **_LocalCoffeeShop must implement multiple payment methods it can't handle_**
- **_Client code must handle exceptions for unsupported payment methods_**
- **_Interface becomes bloated with methods irrelevant to specific implementations_**


### Example: Following ISP

Here's how we can refactor Amazon's payment system to follow ISP using segregated payment interfaces:


!["Following ISP Example"](/assets/img/FollowingISP.png)



#### ISP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design demonstrates clean architecture and ISP compliance:

- **_Focused Interfaces: Each interface serves a single, well-defined purpose without unnecessary bloat_**

- **_Selective Implementation: Classes implement only the interfaces they actually need and can meaningfully support_**

- **_Reduced Coupling: Client code depends only on specific functionality, not entire fat interfaces_**

- **_Enhanced Maintainability: Changes to one interface don't affect unrelated implementations_**

- **_Improved Testability: Smaller, focused interfaces are easier to mock and test in isolation_**

## **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

<img src="/assets/img/D.memes.png" alt="memes" width="400">

### Core Concept

**The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details, and details should depend on abstractions.** 

>This principle promotes loose coupling between components, making the system easier to change and maintain. It also enhances testability by allowing easier mock or stub replacements for dependencies.

### Real World Analogy

>Think about charging your devices. You have a phone, headphones, power bank, and tablet. Each device needs power, but they might use different charging ports: USB-C, Lightning, or micro USB.
Instead of carrying separate chargers for each device, you use adapters or cables that all connect to the same power source. Your power outlet (high level) doesn't care what specific device you're charging (low level details). It just provides electricity through a standard interface.

>This is exactly what happened in Europe when they required Apple and other manufacturers to use USB-C. The focus was on the high-level need (charging devices) rather than forcing everyone to adapt to different proprietary charging systems. Now one charger works for most devices through a common standard.


!["common standard"](/assets/img/commoncharger.png)

### Example: Violating DIP
Let's look at an email system that directly depends on a specific email service:

!["Violating DIP Example"](/assets/img/ViolatingDIP.png)


#### Problems with this approach

- **_NotificationManager is tightly coupled to GmailService_**

- **_Cannot switch to different email providers without changing code_**

- **_Hard to test because Gmail dependency is hardcoded_**

- **_Violates DIP because high-level module depends on low-level implementation_**


### Example: Following DIP

Here's how we can refactor this design to follow DIP using proper abstractions:

!["Following DIP Example"](/assets/img/FollowingDIP.png)


#### DIP Benefits and Architecture

This refactored design demonstrates clean architecture and DIP compliance:

- **_Loose Coupling: NotificationManager doesn't know which specific email service it uses_**

- **_Flexibility: Easy to switch between different email providers_**

- **_Testability: Can easily mock IEmailService for unit testing_**

- **_Maintainability: Changes to email services don't affect the notification logic_**

- **_Extensibility: New email services can be added without modifying existing code_**
