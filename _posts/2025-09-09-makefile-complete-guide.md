## **Introduction**

### **What is a Makefile?**

Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed.

### **Why Do We Use Makefiles?**

#### **Without Makefile (The Hard Way)**

Let's say you have a simple C program with 3 files:

```bash
$ gcc -c main.c                             # Compile main.c to main.o
$ gcc -c utils.c                            # Compile utils.c to utils.o  
$ gcc -c math.c                             # Compile math.c to math.o
$ gcc main.o utils.o math.o -o myprogram    # Link all .o files together
$ ./myprogram                               # Run the program
```

**Problems:**
- You have to remember ALL these commands every time
- You have to TYPE them manually every time  
- If you change ONE file, you might recompile EVERYTHING (very slow)
- Very easy to make typing mistakes
- Hard to share your project with teammates
- No way to easily clean up generated files

#### **WITH MAKEFILE (The Smart Way):**

```bash
$ make                                 # That's it! Just one command! 
$ make clean                           # Clean up files
```

## **Basics**

### **01 - Hello World**

```makefile
# This is your very first REAL Makefile.
# A Makefile is like giving instructions to a robot (your computer).
# You tell it what to do when you type `make` in the terminal.

#            **** Variables ****

# CC stands for "C Compiler".
# Here we are telling Make to use `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile our C programs.
CC = gcc

# CFLAGS stands for "Compiler Flags".
# These are extra options you pass to the compiler to control how it behaves.
# Common flags include:
# -Wall      : "Warn All"  enables most common warnings to help catch mistakes.
# -Wextra    : enables even more warnings that -Wall does not include.
#              It's useful to catch subtle issues in your code.
# -Werror    : treats all warnings as errors.
#              This means the compiler will stop compiling if any warning exists.
#              It helps enforce clean, warning-free code, which is good practice.
CFLAGS = -Wall

# TARGET is the name of the final executable program we want to create.
# In this case, when we build our program, it will be called "hello".
TARGET = hello

# SOURCE is the name of your source file(s).
# Here we only have one source file: main.c
SOURCE = main.c

#            **** Targets ****

# This is the main target.
# Targets are what Make will try to build.
# The syntax is: target: dependencies
# Then on the next line(s), you give the commands to build it (indented with a tab!)
$(TARGET): $(SOURCE)
# This line tells Make: "To build $(TARGET), use $(CC) to compile $(SOURCE) 
# with the flags $(CFLAGS), and output (-o) a file named $(TARGET). in This case hello
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(SOURCE) -o $(TARGET)

# This is a special target called 'clean'.
# It's not a program, but a command we can run to delete generated files.
# 'rm -f' means "remove the file if it exists, and don't ask for confirmation
# This is useful to start fresh before rebuilding your program.
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET)

# .PHONY tells Make that 'clean' is not a real file.
# This prevents conflicts in case a file named 'clean' exists in the directory.
.PHONY: clean

# How to use this Makefile:
 #  1 - compile your program :  make 
 #  2 - run your program :  ./hello
 #  3 - To clean up (delete the executable):  make clean

# Reminder : 
        # Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet
        # I'm here to guide you step by step until you become an expert

```

**main.c:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf ("Hej ! You just built ur first program using Make!");
    return (0);
}
```

### **02 - Target Dependencies**

```makefile
# This Makefile is specifically for - 42 The Network students - 1337 O Nass Lmlah Tahiya!

# Every student working on libft needs to understand the composition of a Makefile.
# As we all know, during correction with peers, there are always a ton of questions like:
#   - Why is this here?
#   - What happens if we delete that?
#   - Can we do it like this instead? Hahaha
#
# Don't worry  I'm here to guide you step by step and help you make the corrector blessed with your knowledge 

#  ===================== VARIABLES  =====================

# NAME: What are we building? A library called libft.a
NAME = libft.a

# CC: Which compiler should we use?
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - Different systems might have different compilers (gcc, clang, cc)
#   - Easy to switch compilers by changing one line
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes! Make has a default CC variable set to "cc" - the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
#   - What happens? Make will use the system default compiler (usually works fine)
CC = cc

# CFLAGS: Compiler flags (extra instructions for the compiler)
# WHY USE THIS? the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
#   -Wall: "Show me ALL warnings" (helps catch bugs early)
#   -Wextra: "Show me even MORE warnings" (be extra careful)
#   -Werror: "Treat warnings as ERRORS" (forces you to write clean code)
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but your code might have hidden bugs
#   - What happens? Compiler won't warn you about potential problems
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror

# RM: How to remove files
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - "-f" means "force" - don't complain if file doesn't exist
#   - Makes our clean commands more reliable
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but then you'd type "rm -f" everywhere
RM = rm -f

# =====================   SOURCE FILES SECTION =====================

# SOURCES: List of all our .c files
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - One place to manage all source files
#   - Easy to add/remove files from the build
#   - The "\" at the end means "continue on next line"
# CAN WE DELETE THIS? the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
#   - No! We need to tell Make which files to compile 
#   - What happens? Make won't know what to build!
SOURCES = main.c \
          utils.c

# OBJECTS: Convert .c files to .o files automatically the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
# WHY USE THIS MAGIC?
#   - $(SOURCES:.c=.o) means "take SOURCES, replace .c with .o"  
#   - So main.c becomes main.o, utils.c becomes utils.o
#   - This is AUTOMATIC - add a .c file above, get a .o file here!
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but then you'd have to list all .o files manually
#   - What happens? More work for you, easy to forget files
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.c=.o)

# ARCHV: How to create a library archive the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - "ar rcs" is the command to create a library (.a file) 
#   - ar = archive tool, r = insert files, c = create, s = write index
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but then you'd type "ar rcs" everywhere
#   - What happens? More typing, and if you need to change the method, you'd
#     have to change it in multiple places
ARCHV = ar rcs

# =====================  RULES SECTION ===================== the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget

# DEFAULT TARGET: What happens when you just type "make"
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - "all" is a conventional name meaning "build everything"
#   - It depends on $(NAME), so it will build our library
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but then typing "make" might not do what you expect
#   - What happens? Make will build the first target it finds
all: $(NAME)

# PATTERN RULE: How to make any .o file from a .c file
# WHY USE THIS MAGIC?
#   - %.o means "any file ending in .o"
#   - %.c means "the corresponding file ending in .c"
#   - $< means "the first dependency" (the .c file)
#   - $@ means "the target" (the .o file)
#   - This ONE rule handles ALL our .c files automatically!
# CAN WE DELETE THIS? the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
#   - Yes, Make has built-in rules for .c to .o
#   - What happens? Make would use its default rule (might not use your CFLAGS)

#   - %.o: %.c utils.h   : Add utils.h as a dependency: this means if anything changes in the header,
#     Make will recompile the source file automatically. the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget

%.o: %.c utils.h   
	@echo "Compiling $< into $@..."
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# LIBRARY BUILD RULE: How to create our library
# WHY DOES THIS WORK?
#   - $(NAME) depends on $(OBJECTS)
#   - If any .o file is missing/outdated, Make will build it first
#   - Then it creates the library from all the .o files
# CAN WE DELETE THE DEPENDENCY? the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
#   - No! Without $(OBJECTS), Make doesn't know what files the library needs
#   - What happens? Make would try to create an empty library!
$(NAME): $(OBJECTS)
	@echo "Creating library $(NAME)..."
	$(ARCHV) $(NAME) $(OBJECTS)
	@echo "Library $(NAME) created successfully!"

# CLEAN: Remove object files but keep the library
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - Object files (.o) are temporary - we don't need them after building
#   - Saves disk space and keeps directory clean
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but your directory will get cluttered with .o files
#   - What happens? Lots of temporary files pile up over time
clean:
	@echo "Cleaning object files..."
	$(RM) $(OBJECTS)
	@echo "Object files cleaned!"

# FCLEAN: Remove EVERYTHING we built (full clean)
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - Sometimes you want to start completely fresh
#   - Removes both object files AND the final library
#   - "fclean" = "full clean" 
# CAN WE DELETE THE "clean" DEPENDENCY?
#   - Yes, but then you'd have to duplicate the object removal commands
#   - What happens? Code duplication (bad practice)

# - fclean depends on clean: this means that when you run `make fclean`,
#   Make will first execute the `clean` target. Think of it like calling a function.
#   After `clean` finishes, fclean continues to remove the executable
fclean: clean
	@echo "Full clean: removing $(NAME)..."
	$(RM) $(NAME)
	@echo "Everything cleaned!"

# RE: Rebuild everything from scratch
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - "re" = "remake" - a common convention
#   - First does fclean (removes everything), then builds all again
#   - Useful when you want to be 100% sure everything is fresh
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but then you'd have to type "make fclean && make" manually
#   - What happens? More typing for a common operation
re: fclean all
	@echo "Rebuild complete!"

# PHONY: Tell Make these are commands, not files the corrector WILL 100% ask you this don't forget
# WHY USE THIS?
#   - Imagine if someone created a file named "clean" in your directory
#   - Without .PHONY, Make would think "clean is up to date" and not run the clean command
#   - .PHONY says "these are always commands, never files"
# CAN WE DELETE THIS?
#   - Yes, but if files with these names exist, the commands might not run
#   - What happens? Your clean/fclean/re commands might stop working!
.PHONY: all clean fclean re

#        Knowledge Check!

#  TARGETS AND DEPENDENCIES:
#   - A target is what you want to make (like "libft.a" or "clean")
#   - Dependencies are what you need to make it (like .c files for .o files)
#   - Make builds dependencies first, then the target
#
#  AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCY TRACKING:
#   - Make compares timestamps: if dependency is newer, rebuild target
#   - This is WHY Make is fast   it only rebuilds what changed!
#
#  VARIABLES:
#   - Variables make your Makefile flexible and maintainable
#   - Change compiler? Just change CC variable
#   - Add new source file? Just add to SOURCES
#
#  PATTERN RULES:
#   - %.o: %.c means "any .o file depends on corresponding .c file"
#   - One rule handles ALL your source files automatically
#
# Try these commands and watch what happens:
#   make          # Build the library
#   make clean    # Remove object files
#   make fclean   # Remove everything
#   make re       # Clean and rebuild
#   touch utils.c # Update timestamp
#   make          # See how only utils.c gets recompiled!

#  How to test your library with a main program:

    # 1 - make   â†’  This creates libft.a
    
    # 2 - cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror  main.c -L. -lft -o test â†’  Compile your main program and link it with the library:
        #      - main.c       â†’ your main source file
        #      - -L.          â†’ tells the compiler to look in the current folder for libraries
        #      - -lft         â†’ links the libft.a library (-l + library name without "lib" and ".a")
        #      - -o test      â†’ names the output executable "test"
    
    # 3 -  ./test â†’ Run your program:

```

### **03 - Simple Pattern**

```makefile
# The name of the final program we want to build (megaphone)
NAME 	:= 	megaphone

CC 		:= 	c++

CFLAGS 	:= 	-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

# All .cpp files in the folder. Example: if you have main.cpp megaphone.cpp ... , both are included automatically
# Why?
# Saves time: you don't have to list every .cpp manually.
SRCS 	:= 	$(wildcard *.cpp)

# Converts every .cpp file into a .o (object) file.
#   Example: main.cpp â†’ main.o
# Why?
# Object files are compiled once, then linked into the final program
OBJS	:= 	$(SRCS:.cpp=.o)

# Default rule. When you run just make, it will try to build megaphone "build everything"

# What if deleted? Make would build the first target it finds (not always what you want)
all: $(NAME)

# What is this?
#   How to build the final program.

# What if deleted?
#  You'd have no final program.
$(NAME): $(OBJS)
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)
	@printf "$(CYAN)\n$(NAME) compiled successfully!\n$(RESET)\n"

# Pattern rule (magic)
#     %.o â†’ any .o file.
#     
#     %.cpp â†’ its matching .cpp source.
#     
#     $< â†’ the source file (main.cpp).
#     
#     $@ â†’ the target file (main.o).
#     
# Why? Handles all .cpp â†’ .o compilations automatically.
#     
# What if deleted?
#     Make would fall back to its default rule, but it might not use your flags

%.o: %.cpp
	@printf "$(CYAN)Compiling $<$(RESET)\n"
	@$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Removes all .o files.
# 
# Why? Keep your repo clean.
# 
# What if deleted?
#     Your repo fills up with .o files â†’ messy.
clean:
	@printf "$(RED)Removing object files$(RESET)\n"
	@rm -f $(OBJS)

# Full clean.
# Removes object files and the final program.
# 
# Why? Sometimes you want to start fresh.
# 
# What if deleted?
#   You can't "reset everything" easily.
fclean: clean
	@printf "$(RED)Removing $(NAME)$(RESET)\n"
	@rm -f $(NAME)

# Rebuild.
#     Deletes everything, then rebuilds from scratch.
# 
# Why? Common shortcut.
# 
# What if deleted?
#     You'd have to run make fclean && make manually.
re: fclean all

# What is this?
# Tells Make these are commands, not files.
# 
# Why? If a file named clean exists in your folder, Make won't get confused.
# 
# What if deleted?
#   Risk that Make thinks your command is "already done".
.PHONY: all clean fclean re

# colors 
RESET	= \033[0m
RED		= \033[31m
CYAN	= \033[36m

#  Tricks 

# @ hides the command, shows only output.
# 
# := expands immediately (safe & predictable).
# 
# = expands later (can change depending on context).

#     ********     The @ flag in Makefile   ******* 
    
test1:
	echo "Hello"   

#         If you run:  
#             make test1

# output : 
#             echo "Hello"
#             Hello

#        If you add @ before the command: 

test2:
	@echo "Hello"
      
#         If you run:  
#             make test2

# output : 
#             Hello

# So @ = "don't echo the command itself, only run it".
# This makes output cleaner and more user-friendly.

#     ********     Diffrence Between  =:   &&  =   ******* 

A = hello
B = $(A) world
A = hej

test3 :
	@printf "$(B)"
	
    # In Makefiles, with = (recursive assignment), variables are expanded only when they are used, not when they are defined
    
    
# if you wanted B to remember the old value of A (so "hello World"), you must use := (immediate assignment):
A := hello
B := $(A) World
A := Hej

test4 :
	@echo "$(B)"
  
# how to run :
    # make 
    # ./megaphone
